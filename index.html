			<p>This document defines the recommended vocabularies for use with the Schema.org accessibility properties
				for discoverability of creative works.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="background">
				<h3>Background</h3>

				<p>The <a href="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><code>CreativeWork</code> type</a> [[schema-org]]
					includes the following accessibility properties for discoverability:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityAPI"><code>accessibilityAPI</code></a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityControl"><code>accessibilityControl</code></a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"><code>accessibilityFeature</code></a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"><code>accessibilityHazard</code></a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary"><code>accessibilitySummary</code></a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessMode"><code>accessMode</code></a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"><code>accessModeSufficient</code></a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>Although schema.org contains many other properties that describe the accessibility of objects in its
					taxonomy, these specific properties were developed together as part of a project to improve the
					discoverability of accessible resources headed by Benetech and IMS Global. Many of these properties
					were derived directly from the <a
						href="http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/afav3p0pd/AfA3p0_DESinfoModel_v1p0pd.html">IMS
						Global AccessForAll (AfA) Information Model Data Element Specification</a>.</p>

				<p>Part of this work included defining vocabularies of recommended values for use with these properties
					to ensure predictability for machine processing. This document represents those vocabularies.</p>

				<p>By defining these vocabularies, not only is it simpler for authors to understand and apply the
					properties, but it ensures that search tools, user agents and other machine intelligence can easily
					parse and inform users of the information.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The vocabulary defined in this document is a continuation of the work that was informally hosted
						on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility">WebSchemas wiki</a> (sometimes
						referred to as the "version 2.0 accessibility properties"). The project was moved to a W3C
						Community Group to better formalize the document and increase the transparency of its update
						process.</p>
					<p>For more information about the original project, refer to the <a
							href="http://www.a11ymetadata.org/">Accessibility Metadata Project's web site</a>.</p>
				</div>

				<p class="note">For more information on how to use schema.org accessibility properties not covered by
					this vocabulary, please refer to their relevant definitions in schema.org.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="naming">
				<h3>Vocabulary Naming Convention</h3>

				<p>The values defined in this vocabulary follow a camel casing convention: single words are lowercase,
					while compound words are concatenated into a single value with a capital letter indicating the start
					of each connected word (e.g., "alternativeText"). This convention is not applied to acronyms,
					accessibility APIs, and other values that already have recognized naming conventions (e.g., "MathML"
					and "iOSAccessibility").</p>

				<p>To ensure maximum interoperability with user agents that process these properties, use the values
					exactly as they are defined in this vocabulary. Alternative case spellings may not be recognized
					(e.g., "mathml" or "aria").</p>

				<p>User agent developers should be aware that these values may not be strictly validated depending on
					the context in which they are created and used. Two values that differ only in case should be
					treated as identical.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="extensions">
				<h3>Extending the Vocabulary</h3>

				<p>To extend terms with more information, this vocabulary used to recommend the old <a
						href="https://schema.org/docs/old_extension.html">slash extension syntax</a> employed by
					Schema.org until 2015. In this model, extensions of a term are made by adding a slash followed by a
					refinement term.</p>

				<p>Authors are no longer recommended to use this extension mechanism, although the use of slashes is not
					formally deprecated for backwards compatibility with existing content. The slash syntax was poorly
					defined, especially when multiple refinements could be specified, making it difficult for machines
					to process.</p>

				<p>When a user may require more information about the characteristics of a resource (e.g., the specifics
					of what type of <a href="#braille">braille</a> it contains), it is better to explain these in
					human-readable terms in an <a href="#accessibilitySummary">accessibility summary</a>.</p>

				<p>If a term in this vocabulary is not be expressive enough, it is now recommended to open an <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues">issue in the tracker</a> to consider how
					to improve the existing term (e.g., by renaming terms or defining more specialized cases).</p>

			<h2>The <code>accessibilityAPI</code> Property</h2>

			<section id="accessibilityAPI-application">
				<h3>Application</h3>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Compatibility with an accessibility API indicates that assistive technologies on the platform should
					be able to access the resource.</p>

				<p>The property is not applicable to resources that are not tightly integrated with their user
					interface. It can describe whether a word processing document that only opens in a specific
					application will work on a given platform, for example, but is not a useful indicator of whether an
					HTML document will, as there are numerous user agents a user could use to render it.</p>

				<p>Setting the property means that the resource is compatible with the given API(s). It does not
					necessarily mean that the content will be fully accessible to any given user group.</p>

				<p>The expected value of the <code>accessibilityAPI</code> property is a list of the compatible APIs.
					For metadata formats incapable of expressing lists, the property should be repeated for each
					API.</p>

				<aside class="example ex-group" title="AccessibilityAPI">

				<p>The <code>accessibilityControl</code> property is used to describe the ability of users to interact

				<p>The property is not applicable to resources that are not tightly integrated with their user

				<h3>Application</h3>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported
						enhancements for accessibility.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>The <code>accessibilityFeature</code> property provides a list of all the applicable accessibility
					characteristics of the content. It allows a user agent to discover these characteristics without
					having to parse or interpret the structure of the content.</p>

				<p>For ease of reading, this section splits the vocabulary into the following distinct groups:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="#structure-and-navigation-terms">Structure and navigation terms</a> identify navigation
						aids that are provided to simplify moving around within the media, such as the inclusion of a
						table of contents or an index.</li>

					<li><a href="#adaptation-terms">Adaptation terms</a> identify content features that provide
						alternate access to a resource. The inclusion of alternative text in an [[HTML]]
							<code>alt</code> attribute is one of the most commonly identifiable augmentation
						features.</li>

					<li><a href="#rendering-control-terms">Rendering control terms</a> identify content rendering
						features that users have access to or can control. The ability to modify the appearance of the
						text is one example.</li>

					<li><a href="#specialized-markup-terms">Specialized markup terms</a> identify that content is
						encoded using domain-specific grammars like MathML and ChemML that can provide users a richer
						reading experience.</li>

					<li><a href="#clarity-terms">Clarity terms</a> identify ways that the content has been enhanced for
						clearer readability. Audio with minimized background noise is one example, while content
						formatted for large print reading is another.</li>

					<li><a href="#tactile-terms">Tactile terms</a> identify content that is formatted for tactile use,
						such as graphics and objects.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The vocabulary also includes <a href="#feature-none">the term "<code>none</code>"</a> that authors
					can set to indicate that the resource does not contain special enhancements. This value avoids the
					ambiguity that can arise if a resource has not been checked.</p>

				<p>The expected value of the <code>accessibilityFeature</code> property is a list of the applicable
					features. For metadata formats incapable of expressing lists, the property should be repeated for
					each feature.</p>

						Related to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure.html">WCAG 2.0 guideline
							2.3</a>.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Identifying potential hazards that a resource poses allows users to determine if a resource poses a
					risk to them and to potentially filter out content that could be harmful.</p>

				<p>If no hazards are known to exist, it is recommended to use the value "<code>none</code>". If the
					content has hazard(s), include positive assertions for the hazards it has and negative assertions
					(the values that begin with "no") for the others.</p>

				<p>If this property is not set for a resource, it is not possible to state whether it presents hazards
					or not. Similarly, if an author sets the value <code>unknown</code>, they are stating that they do
					not know whether hazards are present (e.g., because they do not know how, or are unable, to assess
					them).</p>

				<p>The expected value of the <code>accessibilityHazard</code> property is a list of the applicable
					hazards. For metadata formats incapable of expressing lists, the property should be repeated for
					each hazard.</p>

			<h2>The <code>accessModeSufficient</code> property</h2>

			<section id="accessModeSufficient-application">
				<h3>Application</h3>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual
						content of a resource.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Although the <a href="#accessMode">access modes</a> indicate how the information is encoded in its
					default form, knowing the encoding only describes one possible perceptual pathway through the
					content. For example, a book with textual and visual content will, at the most basic level, require
					an individual who can read text and view images.</p>

				<p>The author of the content may, however, provide alternatives to a specific access mode that allow the
					content to be wholly consumed in another manner. The use of alternative text and extended
					descriptions, for example, can allow a user who cannot perceive visual content to read all the
					information in textual form (e.g., through text-to-speech playback).</p>

				<p>In such a case, a resource with textual and visual access modes could have both a textual and visual
					sufficient access mode <em>and</em> a purely textual access mode &#8212; because there are text
					equivalents for the visual content. Specifying there is an additional textual-only pathway through
					the content allows users of screen readers, for example, to recognize that the content will be
					readable by them.</p>

				<p>It is for this reason that content that has multiple access modes may have one or more sets of
					sufficient access modes: each listing of sufficient access modes provides users with one possible
					combination of reading modes that allow the content to be read in full.</p>

				<p>Although listing the combinations of access modes that allow a user to read all the content is
					helpful, the most important sufficient access modes to list are the single-value ones. Users looking
					for an alternative to the default encoding of the content typically are looking for a single
					presentation mode (e.g., a fully textual pathway to use with a text-to-speech renderer or a fully
					auditory pathway to listen to).</p>

				<p>The expected value of the <code>accessModeSufficient</code> property is an <a
						href="https://schema.org/ItemList">ItemList</a>. Each entry in the ItemList must be a list of
					one or more access modes representing one pathway.</p>

				<p>For formats incapable of expressing lists, the property should be repeated for each set of sufficient
					access modes. In these cases, it is recommended to use a comma-separated list of values.</p>

				<aside class="example ex-group" title="accessModeSufficient">

				<summary>Changes made in 2022</summary>
				<ul>
					<li>06-Feb-2023: Add <code>pageNavigation</code> feature for indicating that a resource has a page
						list. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/6">issue 6</a>.</li>
					<li>06-Feb-2023: Add <code>pageBreakMarkers</code> feature for indicating that a resource includes
						static page break markers. <code>printPageNumbers</code> is retained as a synonym but no longer
						recommended for use. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/6">issue
						6</a>.</li>
					<li>10-June-2022: Removed references to using the slash syntax to extend terms and recommend against
						using the mechanism any more. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/5"
							>issue 5</a>.</li>
					<li>10-June-2022: Clarify that access modes do not apply to presentational content. See <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/38">issue 38</a>.</li>
					<li>10-June-2022: Clarify that single-value sufficient access modes are the most important to list.
						See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/pull/49">pull request 49</a>.</li>
					<li>10-June-2022: Identify hazard and feature property values that must not be specified together to
						avoid ambiguity. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/pull/49">pull request
							49</a>.</li>
					<li>10-June-2022: Ensure all properties identify their expected values and describe how to handle
						less expressive formats like EPUB. See <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/pull/49">pull request 49</a>.</li>
					<li>09-June-2022: Deprecated the <code>bookmarks</code> feature due to its ambiguous definition. The
							<code>tableOfContents</code> and <code>annotations</code> values are recommended in its
						place. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/5">issue 5</a>.</li>
					<li>08-June-2022: Marked the BlackberryAccessibility API as obsolete. See <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/12">issue 12</a>.</li>
					<li>31-May-2022: Clarify the definition of taggedPDF to indicate it is critical for access to the
						content not just for improved navigation. See <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/40">issue 40</a>.</li>
					<li>07-Feb-2022: Restore the "tableOfContents" value for <code>accessibilityFeature</code>. See <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/pull/39">pull request 39</a>.</li>
					<li>04-Feb-2022: The <code>accessibilityAPI</code> value "ARIA" is deprecated. It is replaced by a
						new "ARIA" value for <code>accessibilityFeature</code> for indicating the use of roles of
						enhanced structural and landmark navigation. See <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/4">issue 4</a>.</li>
					<li>26-Jan-2022: The accessibility features have been restructured to better organize them by
						purpose. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/a11y-discov-vocab/issues/10">issue 10</a>.</li>
